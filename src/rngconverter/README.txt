Sun RELAX NG Converter is a tool to convert schemas written in various
schema languages to their equivalent in RELAX NG.

It supports schemas written in XML DTD, RELAX Core, RELAX namespace,
TREX, W3C XML Schema, and RELAX NG itself.

This release includes software developed by the Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To convert a schema written in either RELAX Core, RELAX namespace, TREX,
or W3C XML Schema, enter the following:

$ java -jar rngconv.jar myschema.xsd > result.rng

The converter detects the schema language automatically (except for XML
DTDs) and writes the result to "result.rng".

To convert an XML DTD, enter the following:

java -jar rngconv.jar -dtd myschema.dtd > result.rng

Note that you need the -dtd option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* This software relies on Sun Multi-Schema Validator(MSV). Therefore
  any limitations of MSV apply also to this converter. See [1] for
  more information.

* RELAX Core permits undeclared attributes to appear in instance
  documents. This semantics is not converted. Therefore, any undeclared
  attributes are considered invalid after the conversion.

* Identity constraints of W3C XML Schema are not converted. So if the
  source schema uses <xsd:key>,<xsd:keyref>, or <xsd:unique>, this
  converter ignores those declarations. The semantics of "ID", "IDREF",
  and "IDREFS" are converted properly.

* It may fail to convert some datatype definitions, especially those that
  are derived in a very complex way with lots of facets.

* Schemas that consist of multiple files are converted into one big
  RELAX NG grammar. This limitation can be used to parse modularized
  RELAX NG grammar and create a single monolithic grammar.
