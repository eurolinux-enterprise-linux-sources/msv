(RNG)	changed namespace URI.
(RNG)	@datatypeLibrary supported. data/@type is modified to NCName.


(DTD)   supports DTD.

(both)  fixed a bug that a named type is not properly derived by restriction
        when no facet is specified.
(both)  fixed an inconvenience of error recovery logic.
(both)  fixed a bug in error recovery from bad attribute value error.
        improved error message of bad attribute value error in case of
        "none" type.
(both)  added version message.

2000/03/29 release
------------------
(both)  documents added
(both)  command line Verifier now detects type ofschema automatically.
(both)  switched default parser back to Xerces-J, due to the bug of Crimson
        in SAXParserFactory.setFeature method.
(TREX)  added proprietary type extension mechanism for TREX.
(both)  SAX parser is configured not to read external DTD by default.
        Added error message handler for SAX parse exception.


2000/03/23 release
------------------

(TREX)  added check of "sequenced string". Due to the lack of the formal
        description of exactly what should be prohibited, the current
        implementation is based on the reference implementation by James Clark.
(TREX)  support QName for "name" attribute of "element"/"attribute" declaration.
(TREX)  added support for patterns whose document element is not
        <grammar> element but other arbitrary pattern element.
(dt)    'totalDigit' facet is now correctly implemented.
(dt)    'fractionDigit' facet is now correctly implemented.
(both)  added a mechanism to controll inclusion
(RELAX) Tranquilo will issue an error for <anyOtherElement> with
        both "includeNamespace" and "excludeNamespace" attributes.
(TREX)  error diagnosis for <string> is supported
(TREX)  implemented check for two pattern definitions in the same file
        with the same name.
(TREX)  modified to accept old "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema"
        namespace with a warning.
(RELAX) RELAX reader is modified to recognize obsoleted type names
        such as "decimal","uriReference", with warning.
(dt)    Corrected namespace URI to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        and "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
(both)  Better error diagnosis gets produced when the user forgot to
        declare namespace URI or declared a wrong namespace.


2000/03/20 release
------------------

(RELAX) When obsoleted type names like "uriReference" is used, Tranquilo
        now reports a warning but pretend as if it saw a correct type.
(both)  "Panic mode" is implemented: Tranquilo suppress excessive
        error messages.
(dt)    Updated datatype library to catch up with PR version of XML Schema.
(both)  Fixed a bug that makes validation a little bit slower
        and that sometimes interferes with type-assignment.
(both)  Added "optimistic" type-assignment mechanism for Verifier.
        This is the equivalent of "RELAXEffortlessHandler" which
        is implemented in "RELAX Verifier for Java" by Swift,Inc.
        This mechanism is "optimistic" in the sense that Verifier
        will report type as long as it can decide it; once if Verifier
        fails to decide type, it bails out (verification will be continued).
(both)	Implemented VerifierFilter that acts as XMLFilter.
(both)  Fixed bugs in integer-derived types and uriReference type.
(RELAX) Supports "Java API for RELAX Verifier".
(both)  XML parser can now be choosed from Xerces or Crimson,
        by using a command line switch.
(both)  Performance optimization
(RELAX) Reader now detects ID/IDREF abuse, which is prohibited by
        the formal specification of RELAX.
(RELAX) ID/IDREF types are implemented
(RELAX) Reader signals an error when two <attribute> declarations have the
        same target attribute name.
(both)  Reader signals an error when namespace-unaware ParserFactory is given.

2000/03/09 release
------------------

(both)  done a lot of optimization that makes validation faster
(RELAX) support <anyOtherElement>.
(RELAX) add check for those exported hedgeRules which directly or indirectly
        refer labels of the other namespaces.
(both)  better error recovery for unexpected character literals.
(RELAX) detects an error when unexported elementRules/hedgeRules are
        referenced from the other namespaces.
(RELAX) implements RELAX semantics of ignoring undeclared attributes.
